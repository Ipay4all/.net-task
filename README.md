# .NET-Developer-Coding-Challenge
As the next step in the interview process, weâ€™d like you to complete a coding challenge.

## The Project

You will be building a basic version of a Virtual Product Management (VPM) Dashboard. There's a postman collection in this repository, Access token is required to get product details based on the country UAE. You will need to take product data and persist it in a backend database. You will then develop a backend API, to be called upon by your frontend, which will display the data. This dashboard should allow registration and login of a user, requiring a password, and the user's credentials should also be persisted in your database.

The result should be a dashboard with two pages (the application can be single-page (SPA), or multiple pages):

* A registration/login page
* A main page that displays products with details well formatted 
* User should be able to add products, update details and delete products 

## Requirements

**Git**
* Maintain code on git (github/gitlab).
* Push code with proper commits.
* Create feature branch for each push (registration, dashboard).
* Create a conflict and resolve.

**Backend**
* Develop the backend of the project using C# and any .Net framework of your choice. 
* *product data* and *user credentials* data is persisted in a database. 
  * Each data point should have a corresponding column in the database.
  * You may use any database tool of your choice, such as SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.
* API provides frontend with *product details*, and *verified user credentials*.
* Error handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to ensure the application can gracefully handle any unexpected errors or failures.

**Frontend**
* The frontend of this project can be done in React, Vue, or Angular. You are permitted to use any of these frameworks CLI generators to quickly start a project (npx create-react-app, ng new my-app, etc.)
* Login Page Reuirements
  * Authentication is required to access the application
  * User must register for a new account, or login with an existing account, to proceed to the dashboard
* Main Page/Dashboard Requirements
  * The dashboard page cleanly displays the *product data*
  * User should be able to add product
  * User should be able to delete product
  * User should be able to update product details
  
## Additional Information
* Use the latest version of the .NET Framework for the development of the application.
* Use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize the application
* Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testability
* Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as Entity Framework to interact with the database
* Use GitFlow branching model for managing feature and release branches
* You are free to use any third-party libraries.
* Please make sure to follow best practices, coding standards, and security guidelines while developing the application.
* Have fun and be as creative as you like!
* Please feel free to reach out to ask any questions (rtahir@ipay4all.com).
